API:
pedestrians
being able to control the route of autopilot
different camera types
different sensors (gps, lidar)

Autonomous Control Ideas:
    Approach 1:
    Q-learning based approach that takes the sensor data and takes the target coordinates to approach to.
    The model will try to go to specified coordinates without breaking traffic rules or colliding with any obstacle.
    We will supply the coordinates based on the shortest route for given 10 checkpoints

    Approach 2:
    Process the images to find the objects in the screen, middle point of lanes in the road and weather or not there are
    any obstacle in front. Using these variables, construct a driving logic.

    Approach 3:
    Configure the autopilots to drive in desired route. Track the movement of autopilots
    and train the neural network for replicating their behaviour.

Approach 3 can be used to speed up the training of approach 1. we can get a initially working model from approach 3 quicker
and continue it's training with approach 1.
